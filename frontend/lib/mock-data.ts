## Key Concepts

- **Machine Learning**: A branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
- **Supervised Learning**: Training models using labeled data, where the correct output is provided.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without labeled outputs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interactions with an environment to maximize rewards.

## Core Algorithms

### Regression
- **Linear Regression**: Models relationships between variables using a linear equation.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships.

### Classification
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like models for both classification and regression.
- **Random Forests**: Ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees.

### Clustering
- **K-means**: Partitions data into k clusters based on similarity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Creates a tree of clusters without requiring a pre-specified number.

## Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: Metrics for classification performance.
- **Mean Squared Error, R-squared**: Metrics for regression performance.
- **Cross-validation**: Technique to assess how a model generalizes to independent data.

## Neural Networks
- **Perceptron**: The simplest form of neural network, a binary classifier.
- **Multilayer Perceptron**: Networks with one or more hidden layers.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data and time series.

## Practical Considerations
- **Feature Engineering**: The process of selecting and transforming variables.
- **Overfitting vs. Underfitting**: Balance between model complexity and generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters that are not learned during training.
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Finding the sweet spot between model simplicity and flexibility.`;

## Core Concepts
- **Machine Learning**: AI systems that learn from experience without explicit programming
- **Learning Types**: 
  - Supervised: Uses labeled data
  - Unsupervised: Finds patterns in unlabeled data
  - Reinforcement: Learns through environment interactions

## Key Algorithms
- **Regression**: Linear & polynomial models for relationships between variables
- **Classification**: Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests
- **Clustering**: K-means, hierarchical clustering

## Neural Networks
- **Types**: Perceptron, MLP, CNN (for images), RNN (for sequences)

## Best Practices
- **Evaluation**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, MSE, cross-validation
- **Optimization**: Feature engineering, prevent overfitting, tune hyperparameters, balance bias-variance`;
